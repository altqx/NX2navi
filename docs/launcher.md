# Launcher

NX2navi's launcher installs everything the build needs, builds the game from the player's own dump, starts it, and
keeps the port up to date. Players download one file, `NX2navi-Setup-<version>.exe`; nothing of the game ships with
it. The code is `launcher/`, the release is made by `tools/make_launcher.py`, and the build itself is
`tools/make_game.py` (the build kit's script, [README-BuildKit.md](README-BuildKit.md)).

## What the player does

1. Starts `NX2navi-Setup.exe` (from the folder that holds their `.nup` dump, ideally). It installs the launcher into
   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\NX2navi` without administrator rights, adds Start menu and Desktop shortcuts and an entry
   in Settings > Apps, and opens the launcher. Windows SmartScreen warns once: the programs are not signed.
2. The launcher finds the dump by itself in the setup's folder, Downloads, Desktop, Documents or the top of each
   drive, and proposes `<launcher>\game` as the install folder (or `X:\Games\NX2navi` on the drive with the most
   free space when that drive has less than 40 GB). Both rows can be changed.
3. Selects **Begin Installation**. The launcher downloads the build tools (about 170 MB, once), checks the dump,
   unpacks it, translates and compiles the game: 10 to 25 minutes. It keeps the PC awake meanwhile.
4. Selects **Play**. The launcher hides while the game runs and comes back when it exits.

From then on the launcher looks for a new version when it opens and every hour while it runs, also while it is
hidden during play (Settings can turn that off). A new version downloads in the background, the game playing on, and
installs when the game is not running: right after the game exits, or the next time the launcher opens. The launcher
then restarts in the new version and rebuilds the game. With Install Updates Automatically off (Settings) it waits
until the player selects Updates. Saves and settings are never touched.

## Look

The window follows the game's options menu, with colours sampled from it: a wooden band across the whole top with
Navi and the name, which is also the window's title bar (no system title bar: drag the band to move the window,
minimise and close sit at its right end, Alt+F4 closes), bronze label cells, dark value cells, orange On/Off choices, a white glowing cursor around the selected
row, the menu's filigree dividers and a description box for the selected row. All text is in the game's own Cetra
Display: the launcher decodes it from the player's dump or built game into `data/cache/fonts` (as
`runtime/menu_assets.c` does for the in-game menu) and uses the system's interface font until then. Every picture is
drawn in code (`launcher/ui/art.py`); no texture, font or sound of the game is in the repository or the release.

Navi (`art.NAVI`, 22 x 21 pixels, drawn in whole pixels at every size) is also the icon of `NX2navi.exe`,
`NX2navi-Setup.exe`, the window and its taskbar button (`art.navi_ico`, written into the release by
`tools/make_launcher.py`). The window sets that icon on itself, and the setup's shortcuts carry the window's taskbar
identity (`NX2navi.Launcher`), so the taskbar groups and pins it under NX2navi rather than Python.

Screens (`launcher/ui/app.py`): first run (dump, install folder, Desktop Shortcut, Check for Updates at Start,
Update Channel, Begin Installation); the steps of an install, update or rebuild with their progress, the build log's
last lines and Cancel, and after a failure Try Again and Copy Report; home (Play, Updates, Game Folder, Import Saves,
Rebuild the Game, Settings); settings (update check, Install Updates Automatically, Hide Launcher While Playing, Keep
Build Cache, Update Channel, the folders, Open Logs Folder, Uninstall, Back); uninstall (keep or remove the built game).
A screen with more rows than the window holds draws them closer together (`fit_rows`).

Controls: the mouse (hover moves the cursor, a click selects); the keyboard (arrows, Enter or Space, Esc, F5 checks
for updates); an XInput gamepad (d-pad or left stick, A, B, Y) while the window is in front.

`python -m launcher --selftest --shots DIR` draws every screen with made-up states and saves a PNG of each.

## The launcher's folder

                         release made with --prompt-art, prompt-art/ (the button art the prompts are drawn from); a
                         release staged in the background also holds staged.json and the Python it brings,
                         python.staged/, until it installs

                         saves/ for saves to import (below)
```

A path the Windows ANSI code page cannot hold breaks the MSYS2 tools, so the toolchain then goes to
`C:\NX2navi\toolchain` instead (`launcher/paths.py`).

## Installing

`jobs.InstallJob`, one row per step:

1. **Gather Build Tools** (`launcher/toolchain.py`): the packages `toolchain.lock.json` pins (MSYS2 UCRT64 clang,
   gcc, lld, SDL3, Opus, libvpx, dav1d, zstd, Vulkan headers and loader, VMA and their dependencies: about 32
   packages, 175 MB; and, when the release found the same clang version there, MSYS2 CLANG64's clang with the DLLs
   it loads: 9 packages, about 100 MB),
   each checked against its sha256 and unpacked into `toolchain/msys64.new`, which replaces `toolchain/msys64` once
   complete. No MSYS2 shell or pacman runs. Then zbic: the wheel for the bundled Python from PyPI, checked against
   PyPI's sha256, into `pydeps/`.
2. **Inspect Your Game** to **Compile**: `tools/make_game.py --nup <dump> --out <game> --msys <toolchain> --events`,
   whose `@@` progress lines drive the rows (check, exefs, romfs, lift, compile). How it keeps the build short:
   - The RomFS image (26 GB, mostly disk work) is packed beside the lift and the compile (processor work), so a first
     build takes about as long as the longer of the two. Only `romfs.c`, which includes the RomFS index's
     `romfs_config.h`, waits for the image.
   - Every logical processor compiles, the largest files first, so no big file starts last and runs on alone.
   - The lifted code compiles with MSYS2 CLANG64's clang when the toolchain has it: the same LLVM release as
     UCRT64's, built with profile-guided optimisation, about a fifth faster on this code and writing the same objects
     (it reads UCRT64's headers; `make_game.py` `fast_clang` checks that both report the same version and target).
   - The lifted code is compiled for the processor's own level, x86-64-v3 (AVX2, FMA) or v2 (`cpu_level`): the game
     runs on the PC that builds it, and a generic build would do every fused multiply-add of the game in software.
3. **Prepare the Shaders**: make_game.py translates every shader of the game, in its default bind state,
   into the game's shader cache and builds its stage library or compute pipeline into the driver's own cache
   (`tools/prepare_shaders.py`), so play stops for them far less often. Variants met in play with another bind state are
   still translated then, full pipelines are still linked in play (quickly, from the cached parts), and the driver's
   cache is kept per executable and is lost when the driver clears it. Its bar
   follows the game's own counts, printed every 2 s: the translation fills the first half, the build into the
   driver's cache the second. An update every 10 s keeps the step's text current while nothing is printed, and after
   3 minutes without a count moving it says so, and that the step is still running.
4. **Draw the Button Prompts**, only when the version holds button art (`app/<version>/prompt-art`, a release made
   with `--prompt-art`; `build.has_prompt_art`): make_game.py's last step runs `tools/pad_prompts.py` on that art
   and writes the Xbox, PlayStation and keyboard and mouse prompts into `romfs-patches-*` beside the game (about
   30 s), which the game's Controls > Button prompts loads. The keyboard and mouse prompts show the keys of
   `nx2navi.ini`'s `bind_` lines, so Rebuild the Game after rebinding keys draws them again; the step's key names
   all it reads (the RomFS, the art, the tools, those lines), so it runs again only when one changed or a folder is
   gone, and runs no other step again. Without art the row is not shown and the game keeps its own prompts.
5. **Check the Game Files**: make_game.py's last step runs `tools/romfs_check.py`, once for each copy of the game data
   (about 4 minutes, in worker threads, never while the game runs). It decompresses every file, writes
   `romfs-check.json` beside the game, and for each damaged texture puts a stand-in, another texture of the same kind
   under the damaged one's name, in `mods/Damaged file stand-ins`, so the game can load what needs it. A damaged file
   of any other kind is only reported: only a clean dump restores it. In play the game logs a file it keeps opening
   and cannot load (runtime/romfs.c `open_note`).
6. The game's Cetra Display is decoded for the window.

## Updating

A release carries `NX2navi-update.json` (version, notes, and the size and sha256 of each file). The feed
(`app/<version>/feed.json`) names a GitHub repository: the launcher reads its newest release (or pre-release, on the
Preview channel) that has the manifest. A private repository answers only with a token (`github_token` in
`data/launcher.json`); players need a public one. `feed_repo` in `data/launcher.json` points one launcher at another
repository for testing; `{"type": "url", "url": ".../NX2navi-update.json"}` in feed.json reads one manifest
directly. Every address is https (plain http only to this PC), a redirect to http is refused, and the token is not
sent on when a redirect leaves the host it was meant for (`launcher/net.py`). A manifest that does not give a file's
size and sha256 is refused.

### In the background

The player never waits for a download and play is never interrupted. A check that finds a newer release (the check
at start, then one an hour after the last, also while the window is hidden during play: `jobs.RECHECK`) stages it
at once, without a screen (`jobs.StageJob`, `updater.stage`):

- The app archive is downloaded and checked as in step 1 below and unpacks into `app/<version>` as in step 2. A new
  Python unpacks into `app/<version>/python.staged`, not `python.next`: the stub swaps `python.next` in at every
  start, which would put the running version on the new Python. `app/<version>/staged.json`, written last, marks the
  release complete (`updater.staged_info`); a folder without it, or one that lost its Python, is never installed and
  is staged again. Nothing is switched and the launcher keeps running. The thread runs in Windows' background mode
  (lower processor, disk and memory priority), so it shares only the network with the game.
- A staging that fails is logged in `launcher.log` and tried again after the next check; it never shows an error.
  Selecting Updates then downloads the release with its steps on screen, as below.
- The Updates row reads "Downloading <version>", then "Ready · <version>". A staged release survives a restart of the
  launcher, which finds it without a check (`updater.staged`). A pre-release counts only on the Preview channel; the
  version the stub last rolled back from (`rolled_back` in `data/launcher.json`) is neither staged nor installed by
  itself; a staged release newer than the feed's newest is passed over, as the release was withdrawn. Staging a
  release removes the staged one it supersedes, and `updater.prune` keeps a staged release newer than the current
  version.

`jobs.BackgroundUpdate` installs a staged release only while no copy of the game runs (`build.game_running`, and the
process the launcher started), no job holds the window and no staging is under way:

- by itself, with Install Updates Automatically on (Settings; the default): when the launcher starts, right after the
  game exits (the launcher comes back from hiding), and, checked every minute, once a copy of the game started
  elsewhere that held the install back has closed;
- when the player selects Updates, also with the setting off; selected during the download, it installs as soon as
  the download is done.

Play always starts the game: a release staged meanwhile installs after the game exits. Installing
(`updater.install_staged`) moves `python.staged` to `python.next`, switches `app/current.txt` as in step 3, deletes
`staged.json` (so a version the stub rolls back from is not installed again) and restarts the launcher with
`--continue-update`; the new version finishes in `jobs.ContinueUpdateJob` (steps 4 to 9). A checkout runs from the
repository: it stages and installs nothing.

### Steps

Without a staged release (its staging failed, it is the version the stub rolled back from, or the launcher runs from a
checkout), selecting Updates runs `jobs.UpdateDownloadJob`, before the restart (`launcher/updater.py`):

1. **Download** `NX2navi-app-<version>.zip` (about 3 MB plus the shader translator) to `data/downloads`, resuming a cut
   download, and check its size and sha256. When the manifest names a Python other than `python/runtime-id.txt`, also
   `NX2navi-runtime-<id>.zip`, unpacked into `python.next`.
2. **Verify**: the archive unpacks into `app/<version>.part`, refusing names that leave the folder, holds the expected
   `VERSION` and a launcher, and becomes `app/<version>`.
3. `app/previous.txt` gets the running version, `app/current.txt` the new one, and the launcher starts the stub with
   `--continue-update <old>` and closes.

The stub swaps `python.next` in while no Python runs, then starts the new version, which finishes in
`jobs.ContinueUpdateJob`:

4. **Update Build Tools**: only when the new release pins other packages.
5. **Translate the Code** and **Compile Changed Files**: `make_game.py --rebuild`. Most updates compile almost
   nothing:
   - The exefs and romfs steps depend only on the game files: they are kept, and the dump is not needed again.
   - The lift runs only when the lifter, its patch table or the bring-up fixes changed.
   - The runtime comes prebuilt with the release (`app/<version>/lib/libnx2navirt.a`, compiled by
     `make_game.py --make-runtime-lib` with the release's own compiler). Only the few runtime files that include a
     header written per install (`layout.h`, `patches.h`, `romfs_config.h`) are compiled on the player's PC.
   - Every other file compiles only when its source, a header it includes, the flags or the compiler changed
     (`build-cache/obj/objects.json`, from clang's dependency files). The kit's folder is not part of that key, so the
     objects of the version before are reused although each version lives in its own folder. The compiler counts by
     its version and size, not its file time, and the faster CLANG64 compiler, whose objects are the same, not at all.
     The lifted code includes only `cpu.h` and `simd.h`: a change there compiles it all again, which is rare.
   - An object an earlier version recorded under its own key form is taken over when its compile and its files are
     the same (`ObjectCache.adopt`): 0.6.0's keys, and 0.5.0's, which named the kit's folder. An update keeps the
     x86-64 level the game's code was compiled for (`build-cache/obj/lifted-build.json`; generic for the objects of
     0.5.0 and earlier); Rebuild the Game compiles it for this processor's (`--retune`).
6. **Swap In the New Build**: lld links `ocarina.exe.new`, which replaces `ocarina.exe` only once it is complete. A
   failed rebuild leaves the old build playable; Rebuild the Game tries again.
7. **Prepare the Shaders** is skipped once shaders were prepared before (`shader-prepared.bin`): the game keeps using
   them and translates them again with the new translator in the background (`NX2NAVI_SHADER_CARRY`). With
   `shader_carry = 0`, or nothing prepared yet, the step prepares them all as at the install.
8. **Draw the Button Prompts**, with button art in the new version: only when the art, the prompt tools or the key
   bindings changed, or a prompt folder is missing (a first version with art draws them all).
9. Every version but the current and the previous one is deleted, except a staged release newer than the current
   one.

When the new version fails to start (exit code 86 from `start.pyw`, or any error within six seconds), the stub sets
`current.txt` back to `previous.txt`'s version and starts it with `--rolled-back`. The game is never rebuilt while it
runs. Keep Build Cache off deletes the lifted C and the objects (about 5 GB) after each build but keeps
`build-cache/state.json`, so updates still rebuild without the dump (compiling everything).

## Importing a save

Import Saves (home, under Game Folder; `launcher/saves.py`) makes another save the game's own. The game folder has
a `saves` folder with a README for it: a save put there (its files, or the folder that holds them) is taken first,
and the row then reads "From the Saves Folder"; otherwise selecting the row asks for the folder. It recognises a
Switch save backup (the save's files), an emulator's save folder (nested folders named by user and title ids), and
another NX2navi game folder or its profile folder (the account folder inside). A folder with `progress.sav` at its
top is one save slot: it replaces that slot (`slot_00` to `slot_05`, by the folder's name, else `slot_00`) and the rest
of the current save stays. A folder with more than 4,000 files or 1 GB is refused as picked by mistake.

The game keeps its save in `profile/save/<account>`, named after `profile/account.uid` (made as the game would when
it never ran). The import copies the save the game would load now (a finished commit still waiting in
`profile/save-tx`, else the account folder) to `saves/backup <date time>`, puts the new files in place and empties
`profile/save-tx`, so the game loads the imported save. A save taken from the saves folder moves to
`saves/imported <date time>`. It refuses while the game runs.

## Downloads

Every download (`launcher/net.py`) comes over HTTPS and is checked against a sha256. A server's certificate is checked
first by Python's OpenSSL against the certificates in Windows' stores and, when that refuses it, by Windows' own
certificate check (the truststore package of the bundled Python; not under Wine, whose crypt32 passes a chain that
stops at an issuer it does not know). OpenSSL sees only the roots the PC already holds, and it takes an expired
cross-signature still in a store before the server's valid one ("certificate has expired" on a valid chain); Windows
weighs every chain as its own programs do and downloads a missing root from Windows Update. A certificate both refuse
stops the step with what each check said, the PC's clock against the server's (the Date of a plain-HTTP request to
it), and what to check: the date, time and time zone, or security software that scans encrypted connections.

## Uninstalling

Settings > Uninstall NX2navi, or Settings > Apps > NX2navi (which runs `NX2navi.exe --uninstall`): what the launcher
put in its folder (`NX2navi.exe`, `python`, `app`, `pydeps`, `data`, `toolchain`; `launcher/winsys.py` `OWNED`), the
toolchain in `C:\NX2navi` when it went there, the shortcuts and the Apps entry go; the launcher's folder itself goes
only when that leaves it empty. The built game and its saves stay unless "Remove the Built Game" is On, also when the
game folder is the default `<launcher>\game`. The dump is never touched.

## Command line

`launcher/cli.py` runs the same jobs without the window (`python -m launcher.cli`, or in an installed launcher
`python\python.exe app\<version>\launcher\cli.py`): `check`, `update`, `tools`, `install --dump F --game D`,
`rebuild [--game D]`, `fonts`. `NX2navi.exe --desktop-shortcut on|off` and `--shortcuts on|off` are the stub's own.
`NX2navi-Setup.exe` takes `--dest DIR`, `--no-shortcuts`, `--no-launch` and `--quiet`.

## Releases

1. Bump `VERSION`; build the shader translator (`tools/build_xlate.py`).
2. With Python 3.14, numpy (the icon is drawn with it, `launcher/ui/art.py`) and uv, on Windows (the prebuilt runtime
   needs MSYS2's own clang; on Linux add `--wine` to run it through Wine, else the release ships without it and
   players compile `runtime/` themselves):

   ```powershell
   uv run --no-project --python 3.14 --with numpy tools\make_launcher.py --xlate build\xlate --ffx amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll --feed owner/name --notes notes.md
   ```

   `--ffx` puts AMD's signed `amd_fidelityfx_vk.dll` (FidelityFX SDK 1.1.4) in the release for FSR 3.1.
   NVIDIA's `nvngx_dlss.dll` goes in by itself: the script downloads the version `tools/dlss_pin.py` pins from
   NVIDIA's DLSS SDK repository (cached in `toolchain/launcher-dl/`), checks its size and sha256, and puts it in
   `bin/` with `nvngx_dlss-NOTICE.txt`; `make_game.py` copies both beside the game. `--dlss FILE` takes a copy on disk
   instead (it must be the pinned file), `--no-dlss` leaves DLSS out. NVIDIA's RTX SDKs License lets an application
   ship the library; it also asks that a commercial release be announced to NVIDIA first
   (https://developer.nvidia.com/sw-notification) and that the use of DLSS be credited.

   `--dlssg nx2navi_dlssg.dll` (built by `tools/build_dlssg.py`, which needs Visual Studio's C++ compiler) adds DLSS
   Frame Generation in `bin/dlssg/`: beside it NVIDIA Streamline's runtime (`sl.interposer.dll`, `sl.common.dll`,
   `sl.dlss_g.dll`, `sl.pcl.dll`, `sl.reflex.dll`) and `nvngx_dlssg.dll`, taken from the Streamline SDK release that
   `tools/streamline_pin.py` pins. The script downloads that release once (cached in `toolchain/launcher-dl/`), checks
   the archive's size and sha256 and each file's sha256, and writes `dlssg-NOTICE.txt` with the two licence texts;
   `make_game.py` copies the whole set beside the game. `--streamline SDK` takes an SDK folder on disk instead (its
   files must be the pinned ones).

   `--prompt-art FOLDER ...` puts the button art in the release (`app/<version>/prompt-art`): folders that hold
   `XGamepad`, `P5Gamepad` and `Keyboard_Mouse` (the Source folders of button prompt art packs), or those three
   folders themselves; a set named itself wins over one found inside a folder named, and the same set twice is
   refused. Only the pictures `tools/pad_prompts.py` reads are copied (`tools/prompt_art.py`
   `art_files`: the pad pictures it names and every key of `Keyboard_Mouse/Dark` and `/White`, about 280 PNGs and
   1 MB), and it stops first naming any that are missing. The art goes into the release only, never into the
   repository (`.gitignore` has `/prompt-art/`). Without it the release has no art and the build draws no prompts.
   `tools/make_kit.py` takes the same option for the build kit.

   On Linux it cross-compiles the two programs with clang, lld and llvm-windres against the same MSYS2 packages and
   unpacks Tcl/Tk with msiextract (msitools). It writes into `build/launcher-release`: `NX2navi-Setup-<version>.exe`
   (the setup program with the launcher folder appended as a zip), `NX2navi-app-<version>.zip` (with the prebuilt
   runtime),
   `NX2navi-runtime-<id>.zip` and `NX2navi-update.json`. `check_content` runs over the folder first.
3. Upload those four files to GitHub release `v<version>` of the feed repository, by hand or with `--publish`
   (`gh release create`; add `--draft` to look before it goes out). Launchers see it at their next start.

The release resolves the MSYS2 packages of the day into `toolchain.lock.json` (`--lock` reuses an older lock). The
repository keeps old package files, so a release keeps building with the compiler it was tested with.

## Tests

`python tests/launcher_test.py` (Python 3.14): versions, settings, the toolchain resolver and installer against a
local fake repository, resumed and checked downloads, the certificate checks against a local HTTPS server (its
certificates made with the `openssl` command), the GitHub and URL feeds, staging, switching, rollback and
pruning, unsafe archives, the background update (a release staged beside the running version without switching, the
`staged.json` marker, a staged release installed after a restart, no install while the game runs, the install once
it exited, nothing by itself with Install Updates Automatically off, a failed staging tried again after the next
check), the font decoding on a system font wrapped like the game's, `make_game.py` on a synthetic
`.nup` (events, skipped steps, `--rebuild` without the dump, step keys), the RomFS step beside the lift and compile
and its failure stopping the build, the prompts step with a stand-in prompt tool (when it runs again, and that it
makes no other step run), the button art a release copies and the packages and tools the prompts need in a release,
the compile step's object cache with the system's C compiler and its
largest-first order, its windres call under folders with spaces in their names, CLANG64's clang in the lock and the
install, the save import (the account folder, the save folders it recognises, backup, the commit journal, the saves
folder, refusals), the install job with a fake
`make_game.py` (with and without the prompts row), and the window's selftest when a display is there.

## Requirements and limits

- Windows 10 or 11, x86-64; the build's own requirements (README-BuildKit.md): 16 GB of RAM, about 30 GB free for
  the game and 1.5 GB for the launcher and its tools, a Vulkan 1.3 GPU.
- The programs are not signed: SmartScreen warns on the first start of the setup.
- English only for now.
- The launcher builds the Windows game only; Linux builds use `docs/building.md`.
